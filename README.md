# 🎯 GuessingRandomNumber-java

A simple **Java console-based number guessing game** built using basic control structures, random number generation, and user input handling.

---

## 📘 Description
The program generates a **random number between 1 and 30**, and the player has **5 attempts** to guess it correctly.  
After each guess, the computer provides a hint indicating whether the guessed number is **higher** or **lower** than the generated one.

This mini project demonstrates fundamental Java programming concepts such as:
- Loops and conditionals  
- Random number generation (`Math.random()`)  
- User input using `Scanner`  
- Basic game logic and flow control  

---

## 🧠 Game Rules
1. The computer generates a random number between **1 and 30**.  
2. The player gets **5 attempts** to guess the correct number.  
3. After each guess:
   - The program tells if your guess is higher or lower.
   - Displays how many attempts are left.
4. If the player guesses correctly, the game congratulates them.
5. If all attempts are used, the program ends and shows that all attempts are exhausted.
